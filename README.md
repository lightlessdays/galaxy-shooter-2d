## How to Play?

The rules of the game are simple.

-You get three lives. You have to destroy as many enemies as possible and try to beat the highscore.

-For each enemy hit using a bullet, you get a point.

-Everytime an enemy hits you, you lose a life.

-There are three powerups in this game: Speed, Shield and Triple Shot. Shield protects you from enemies. Virtually, it gives you an extra life. This means that if you have shield and an enemy hits you, you won't lose a life. Speed increases your speed in the game. Triple shot spawns three lasers (instead of one) from the player.

-Press spacebar to shoot bullets.

-Use arrow keys or W,A,S,D keys to move the player.
